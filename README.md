- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lonard
- 👀 I’m interested in advanced control theory and signal processing in EV powertrain.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use extended Kalman filter with Empirical Mode decomposition (EMD)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing and coding for robust control (Model predictive control, observers, etc) for any system in EV powertrain
- 📫 How to reach me: use my @EMail t.lonard@yandex.com
